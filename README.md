## Update Note ##

Due to some issues with Telethon I had to use another library: Pyrogram.

I rebuilt project structure and made some significant changes. Code presented in this directory is made only to show
main functions and concepts. I was not really interested in learning Pyrogram features, so I left space for executive 
code.
